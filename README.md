# JMT-Factorize
Putting the best bits of modded minecraft back into the bukkit API

Why? I'm having a minor mental breakdown. Past me decided this would be "fun". I have no idea what they were thinking 

Also because the Bukkit API means only the server needs to do the actual mod processing. Meaning my terrible laptop might run it

And because I think I can do it in less processing than actual mods can

## TODO

* Improve README
* Centralise DSUs
* Add more stuff
